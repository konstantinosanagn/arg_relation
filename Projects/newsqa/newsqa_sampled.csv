"Washington (CNN) -- Shots fired at a congressman's campaign headquarters. Windows smashed at Democratic offices across the country. A coffin placed on a lawmaker's lawn. Hate-filled voice mail messages left on members of Congress' phone lines.

Those are just some of the incidents reported since the House passed historic health care reform legislation Sunday -- a bill that became the law of the land.

The issue has unleashed a deep-seated anger from those worried about a government takeover of health care, and what they deem as the process being ""rammed through"" Congress.

James Leach, with the National Endowment for the Humanities, said that while many of the acts may be protected under First Amendment rights, ""that doesn't mean that they're morally justified.""

""And we have to think of ourselves as, 'what kind of people are we?' "" Leach said. ""Are we one people working together with rival thoughts, or are we enemies within? And I think there's something that's been let loose in American politics that has to be thought about.""

That anger was visible in unruly protests by health care activists at the Capitol over the weekend.

Republican House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery, some of whom carried messages like ""Vote no or else"" or ""If Brown won't stop it, a Browning will"" -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol.

But the anger has boiled over into physical and verbal threats. Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states, and federal agents are investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman's brother was related to the lawmaker's yes vote.

Republicans have the right to be angry over the Democrat's health care bill, but ""resorting to violent measures is exactly the wrong way to send a message,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Thursday night.

Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, confirmed Thursday that his district office in Queens received an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter.

Later Thursday, Weiner told CNN that initial tests indicated the powder was not a biological agent, but that he still was awaiting final word from the New York Police Department. Workers at the office turned over their clothes for testing and were given protective suits before being allowed to go home a few hours later, Weiner said.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are now looking into the threats, and at least 10 House Democrats have been given extra security.

The voice mail has been vicious toward Michigan's Bart Stupak, who switched his vote to seal the deal for the bill. He has released one of the voice mails.

Listen to the voice mail

""Stupak, you are a lowlife, baby-murdering scumbag, pile of steaming crap. You're a cowardly punk, Stupak, that's what you are. You and your family are scum,"" an unidentified caller said. ""That's what you are, Stupak. You are a piece of crap.""

""Go to hell, you piece of [expletive deleted]"" another caller said.

On Sunday, Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri had a coffin placed on his lawn, said his spokeswoman, Sarah Howard. She said Tea Party protesters at his office in St. Louis had a coffin with them and later brought it to his house. The coffin was later removed, she said.

Democratic congressional leaders have demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday's vote on the health care system overhaul.

The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, condemned the threats and vandalism, telling reporters Thursday that it ""should not be part of a political debate.""

""There are ways for people to channel their anger, and they should do it in a constructive way,"" he said.

Liz Mair, a Republican consultant, said protesters ""are unfortunately crossing a line.""

""When we're talking about violence, vandalism, threats, that crosses a legal line, in addition to being in plain old bad taste,"" Mair said. ""And I think that there's a lot that is in plain old bad taste that is going on.""

Democrats aren't the only ones being targeted.

Rep. Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, said Thursday that a bullet had been fired through a window at his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia.

Watch Cantor warn against Democrats ""fanning flames""

A Richmond police spokeswoman confirmed to CNN that a bullet was fired at the congressman's office. ""We are investigating the circumstance surrounding it,"" spokeswoman Karla Peters said.

Cantor also said that he had received threatening messages but that he would not publicly release the messages out of concern that doing so would only incite further violence.

He also accused Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- a member of the Democratic House leadership -- of ""fanning the flames"" of violence by using threats that have been made against Democratic members ""as political weapons.""

iReport: 'Violent Threats after the Healthcare Signing'

""Enough is enough,"" Cantor said. ""It has to stop.""

Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse hit back against Cantor's claims.

""We disagree with the charge made by Rep. Cantor today that Democrats are using acts of violence for political gain,"" he said. ""Let's be clear: Calling on Republican leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate.""

Another Republican -- Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida -- said in a news release Thursday that she received what appeared to be a death threat on her district office's voice mail.

""Just wanna let you know I have 27 people that are going to make sure that this b**** does not live to see her next term. Goodbye,"" the voice mail said, according to the release.

Brown-Waite said she contacted both the Capitol Police and the Hernando County sheriff, and they are ""looking into the matter and subpoenaing telephone records.""

At least one of the threats aimed at lawmakers appears to be racially based.

House Democratic Majority Whip James Clyburn, who is African-American, said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home.

""We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up,"" Clyburn told CNN. ""We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. It doesn't make sense. That's not what a democracy is all about.""

Democratic officials and liberal Web sites are also upset that Sarah Palin used an image of crosshairs in a Facebook post this week listing 20 vulnerable Democrats who voted for the legislation. She plans to target them this election year with money from her political action committee.

Palin's team is fighting claims that she is encouraging threats of violence. One House member mentioned her Facebook posting during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns, a Democratic source told CNN's Dana Bash. Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room, the source said.

An adviser to Palin responded by pointing to several instances in which the former Alaska governor has urged supporters to focus their energies on civil debate and action at the ballot box, not extremist activities.

CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Dana Bash, Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick, Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Facetime with Saad Hariri, Leader of Future Movement

Saad Hariri is the leader of Lebanon's majority party, Future Movement.

Lebanon's economic growth may have slipped from an estimated 7 percent to 4 percent so far this year, but according to politician and businessman Saad Hariri, the country should largely escape the effects of the global slowdown.

The leader of Lebanon's majority party talks to MME about the credit crisis, its impact on remittances, and how he believes peace in the Middle East is the only way to bring political and economic stability to his country.

In focus -- The Land Grab

The Gulf might have oil, but it has a shortage of arable land. A year ago, food prices skyrocketed and there were shortages of all kinds -- even for basics, such as bread.

The shortage caught the region flat-footed, and now food security is a top concern for many countries. It has prompted the likes of Saudi Arabia and Qatar to use their petro-dollars to buy farmland in Africa and Asia to feed their people.

In the long run, could this search for food security also develop sustainable agricultural businesses and local jobs in the process?

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Kanye West may be able to take time off to think about his life after all now that his concert tour has been canceled.

Kanye West has canceled his ""Fame Kills"" tour with Lady Gaga. It was announced two weeks ago.

Concert promoter Live Nation said Thursday that West's concert tour with Lady Gaga, titled ""Fame Kills,"" has been canceled just two weeks after it was announced.

The reason for the cancellation was not revealed. West told NBC's Jay Leno last month, before the tour was officially announced, that he planned ""to take some time off"" in the aftermath of his MTV Awards show embarrassment.

The three-month, 34-show tour across the United States and Canada was to start next month. Tickets went on sale last week.

Live Nation said people who bought tickets could get refunds at the point of purchase. Tickets purchased online and on the phone will be refunded automatically, the promoter said.

West caused a ruckus at the MTV Awards last month when he put down his bottle of cognac, jumped on the MTV Music Video Awards stage and grabbed the microphone from singer Taylor Swift as she was giving an acceptance speech.

West, who apologized the next day on ""The Jay Leno Show,"" seemed to blame his erratic behavior on the lack of time he had to grieve his mother's death two years ago.

""I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, celebrities, they never take the time off, and I've never taken the time off to really, you know, I just, music after music and tour after tour on tour,"" West told Leno.

CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.

"Mission Viejo, California (CNN) -- When Marty Kubicki received a text message that his wife, Aahmes, and two teenage daughters, Olivia and Alexis, were alive in Haiti, he was overwhelmed with relief.

""I felt like an enormous burden had been placed off me, but at the same time I knew that they were OK. I always felt they made it,"" he said. Groups of church members have been volunteering at an orphanage for nearly six years, since church members Bill Manassero, his wife Suzette, and Jim Duggan opened the center.

But by Friday there was chaos at the Maison De Lumiere Orphanage in Haiti as 11 American missionary volunteers were trying to find a way to leave after severe shortages of food, water and medicine sparked anger in people they had been trying to help.

""People are becoming hostile at the missionary workers and we now find ourselves desperately trying to get them out,"" said Mike Maiolo, senior pastor of the volunteers' home church in Mission Viejo. He said he had received urgent messages from Haiti that everyone wanted to leave.

The Kubickis and the others from Mission Viejo Christian Church arrived in Port-Au-Prince a week ago to help assist nearly 100 abused and abandoned children at the orphanage.

The facility sustained heavy damage in the earthquake but no one was killed, he said.

Within hours of the quake, the volunteers became de facto nursing assistants after word spread that Maison De Lumiere was serving as a makeshift triage center.

""Lots of doctors and nurses have been coming by the facility because word's gotten out, so there's all these people being pulled out of rubble and they're assisting and attending to the injured as best as they can,"" Marty Kubicki said.

Judy Beltis left her husband, six daughters and five grandchildren in California when she came to Haiti on January 8. Moments after the walls and shelves around her collapsed, she found herself attending the injured and working to save lives, said her husband, Paul.

""This is a mom who couldn't put a Band-Aid on her kids when they had a cut finger because she was so squeamish, and now she's dealing with whatever needs to be done,"" he said.

On Thursday, the family was assured that Judy Beltis was safe and protected. ""I'm going to urge her at some point to come back and get a little rest and restoration, but I know she'll want to head right back,"" said daughter Jaime.

But that was before Maiolo received the urgent messages late Thursday.

He said the situation had deteriorated to the extent that no one felt safe going outside the compound. Contact with his missionary members in Haiti has been limited to occasional text messages, Internet streaming and e-mail, he said, and his volunteers have not been able to reach U.S. State Department officials.

""The world around us is in such need when something like this happens and we've got to be there for them, but at the same time, there must be a quick way to get them out when there is nothing more to give,"" Maiolo said.

"DEKALB, Illinois (CNN) -- Eric Mace says he thought he was giving his daughter good advice by asking her to sit up front in class.

Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at Northern Illinois University.

""I'd like you to sit in the front row of every class that you're in and constantly drag information out of these people, and if you don't understand what they're talking about, raise your hand and say, 'I don't get it' until you get it,"" Mace recalled telling her.

His daughter, 19-year-old Ryanne, took that advice. Now, he wishes she would have sat somewhere else.

Mace believes that Ryanne was probably one of the first to be killed in the Northern Illinois University shootings a year ago, because she was in the front row in the lecture at Cole Hall.

""She was, from what I understand, in the front row of that room and was probably the first one that had shots fired at her after the gentleman that was on stage,"" Mace said.

""It's not an easy thing to carry, but I shouldn't have to carry it, either.""

Ryanne was Eric and Mary Kay Mace's only child. She was one of five NIU students killed on Valentine's Day last year by Steven Kazmierczak, a former NIU student who was attending graduate school at the University of Illinois in Champaign.

""It's difficult. There's always an ache, loneliness and a longing. We're going to miss her every day for the rest of our lives,"" Mary Kay Mace said.

Her husband added, ""I go to bed thinking about her. I wake up in the morning thinking about her. Any time that I've a free moment, it will pop up.""

The Maces said they would like to know more about the police investigation into the shooting and Kazmierczak's history of mental illness. Police records provided to CNN indicate that he had a long history of mental problems, including several suicide attempts.

The parents also are angry that he was able to buy guns.

Because Kazmierczak had not been in a mental facility for more than five years, he was legally able to purchase those weapons in Illinois -- and on the firearms application form Kazmierczak filled out, he stated that he had never been adjudicated ""mentally defective"" and had never been ""committed to a mental institution.""  See some of Kazmierczak's mental health records »

""I don't know if they don't report it if he's a juvenile with the mental illness on his record or what. But somewhere along the line, the pertinent information didn't get into the right database, and he could waltz out of a store with a legally purchased weapon,"" Mary Kay Mace said.

""And I don't get that. That is what makes me angry.""

Now, the Maces have started a scholarship foundation for psychology majors in honor of their daughter. And they hope that what happened a year ago is never forgotten.

""I don't want them to forget a single detail about it, because the details aren't going to change just by forgetting about them,"" Eric Mace said.

"Miami (CNN) -- The 4-year-old girl sobbed as rescuers rushed her ashore. In the boat behind her, the faces of her fellow survivors were painted with ""a thousand-yard stare,"" one witness said Monday.

That girl and three others spent 20 hours stranded in stormy water after their 22-foot boat capsized off the Florida Keys over the weekend. They were picked up Sunday afternoon by Coast Guard rescuers.

A few hours earlier, David Jensen was maneuvering the Snap Shot, his fishing charter boat, from Duck Key to the open sea when he and others ""saw a big object floating in the distance.""

""The closer I got, I could see a guy waving,"" Jensen said.

They found three men clinging to part of what had been their boat. One charter customer quickly jumped in to help, while others threw life jackets to the men, only one of which could muster the energy to swim over, Jensen said.

Once aboard, a language barrier -- the rescued men were Spanish-speaking -- and raw emotions made it difficult to ascertain exactly what had happened. One who did speak English was very upset: ""He lost his mother,"" Jensen explained.

Officer Robert Dube of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Monday that a son had tried to hold onto his 79-year-old mother in the hours after their ship went down around noon Saturday. But she slipped away into the rough waters, Dube said, before rescuers could reach her.

This victim, later identified as Zaida San Jurjo Gonzalez, and the men had clung to the capsized boat's hull. But four others -- three women and the young girl -- couldn't hold on, and drifted off, Jensen said, based on his conversations with the survivors and authorities.

The charter boat captain contacted the Coast Guard after learning others were unaccounted for, and he took his boat out five miles in the direction where the four had drifted away.

He saw no signs of them. But rescuers did come upon the four Sunday morning, bringing them aboard near Marathon, which is roughly halfway between Key Largo and Key West, according to a Coast Guard statement

Authorities later learned that the three women, wearing life jackets, had held tight to a floating cooler and took turns holding the girl through the afternoon, night and next morning.

""That definitely saved their lives,"" Dube told CNN. ""It could have been a lot worse situation.""

Wayne Crosby of Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center said he watched rescuers bring the four to a dock in Marathon on Sunday. They handed the girl off the boat first, he told CNN affiliate WSVN.

""They had her all wrapped up. ... She couldn't stop crying. She was panic-stricken,"" Crosby said.

At the dock, rescuers scrambled to tend to all the victims.

""They just had that look on their face, like a thousand-yard stare,"" Crosby told WSVN.

The group had suffered multiple jellyfish stings over the course of their ordeal, Dube said. And by Monday, the 4-year-old had been treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion. But the wildlife officer added that, by then, she appeared to be ""in very good spirits.""

Ernie Perroncello, owner and operator of Sea Tow in Marathon, said weather in the area Saturday when the boat went down was terrible.

""You can get yourself in trouble real quick "" on the area's water, said Perroncello, whose company salvaged the capsized boat.

CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Russia will begin the construction of a new naval base this year in Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region of Abkhazia, according to a Russian media report Monday.

Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine that expires in 2017.

Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted an unnamed official at Russian naval headquarters as saying it wanted to station vessels at the Abkhaz port of Ochamchire on the Black Sea, Reuters.com reported.

""The fundamental decision on creating a Black Sea Fleet base in Ochamchire has been taken,"" the official told Tass, in quotes carried by Reuters.com. ""This year we will begin practical work, including dredging, along Abkhazia's coast.

""It will take more than a year to implement all works."" The official added that the deployment was to protect the breakaway region from Georgian attacks.

Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7 last year. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions.

The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have made accusations of ethnic cleansing.

Moscow has since recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent regions -- a move which angered many Western governments who suspect Russia of acting to thwart Georgia's ambitions of joining NATO.

This latest development comes despite comments made last year by Abkhazia's leader that his territory would not be hosting Russian military bases.

""There will be no new bases,"" Sergei Bagapsh told Russia's Novosti news agency, adding that Russia's Black Sea Fleet will not be based in the republic either.

""Only units of Russia's ground forces that have always been based here will continue to be stationed in Abkhazia,"" he said.

Russia's Black Sea Fleet is currently based in the port of Sevastopol which belongs to Ukraine -- another former Soviet state which, like Georgia, aspires to NATO membership.

The fleet is due to leave Ukraine for good in 2017, in line with a 20-year lease deal signed in 1997. However, Russia's diplomats and military have said they want the fleet to stay at its traditional home base after the expiry of the deadline, Reuters.com reported.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Venus Williams ensured the Wimbledon final would be another family affair with a devastating performance against Russia's Dinara Safina in Thursday's second semifinal.

Venus dropped only one game as she crushed top seed Dinara Safina to reach her eighth Wimbledon final.

Third seed Venus produced an awesome display on Centre Court, crushing world No.1 Safina 6-1 6-0 in just 51 minutes, after sister Serena had earlier won an epic three-set semifinal against Elena Dementieva.

There was no way five-times champion Venus, was being sucked into such a dogfight.

Her match was a much more subdued affair as she outclassed the top seed from the moment she settled into the match, winning the first nine points and breaking the Safina serve.

Safina simply could not cope with the Williams serve, with one ace in the third game clocking in at 124mph, the fastest in the women's tournament.

Safina managed to get her side of the scoreboard ticking in the sixth game but it was no consolation as Venus stepped up the power on her groundstrokes.

When Venus broke the Safina serve again at the start of the second set the match was essentially over.

Unforced errors sprayed from Safina's racket throughout the second set and a double fault in the fifth game handed Williams another break of serve.

The end eventually came when Safina dumped another forehand into the net to allow Venus to take the match, after which she expressed her delight at another all-Williams, all-American final on July 4.

Venus told the BBC: ""This is my eighth final and it is a dream come true to have another opportunity to hold the plate up.

""I was able to stay focused and I have so much experience on this court. But the hardest part has to come, to play Serena in the final.""

"(CNN) -- Friends and colleagues of Apple founder Steve Jobs sent their condolences Wednesday after his death at the age of 56.

On its homepage, Google carried a small notation, ""Steve Jobs, 1955-2011."" Clicking on Jobs' name took users to the Apple website and its tribute to Jobs.

U.S. House Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia:

""There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs invention does not better my family's life. Thank you Steve.""

U.S. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio:

""Steve Jobs changed the world for the better (with) his innovations & genius. R.I.P.""

San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee:

""Steve Jobs was a giant in the world of technology and established the Bay Area as a global center for innovation. He has inspired and changed the Bay Area and the world forever. Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco and his values were reflected in his generous support for results-driven education reform, 21st century philanthropy and bridging the digital divide for our diverse communities. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene, his family and friends.""

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg:

""Tonight, America lost a genius who will be remembered with Edison and Einstein, and whose ideas will shape the world for generations to come. Again and again over the last four decades, Steve Jobs saw the future and brought it to life long before most people could even see the horizon. And Steve's passionate belief in the power of technology to transform the way we live brought us more than smart phones and iPads: it brought knowledge and power that is reshaping the face of civilization. In New York City's government, everyone from street construction inspectors to NYPD detectives have harnessed Apple's products to do their jobs more efficiently and intuitively. Tonight our city -- a city that has always had such respect and admiration for creative genius -- joins with people around the planet in remembering a great man and keeping Laurene and the rest of the Jobs family in our thoughts and prayers.""

California Attorney General Kamala Harris:

""California has lost a great leader with the passing of Steve Jobs. His character, intelligence, and creativity changed how the world works and how the world imagines itself. We are forever grateful and inspired by the gift he has given us. I send my thoughts and sympathies to Laurene and the entire Jobs family.""

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney:

""Steve Jobs is an inspiration to American entrepreneurs. He will be missed.""

John Lasseter, chief creative officer, and Ed Catmull, president, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios

""Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary, our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family. He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us, and beyond what anyone ever imagined. Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films; the one thing he always said was to simply 'make it great.' He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength, integrity and love of life has made us all better people. He will forever be a part of Pixar's DNA. Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time.""

Meg Whitman, president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard:

""Steve Jobs was an iconic entrepreneur and businessman whose impact on technology was felt beyond Silicon Valley. He will be remembered for the innovation he brought to market and the inspiration he brought to the world.""

Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt:

""Today is very sad for all of us. Steve defined a generation of style and technology that's unlikely to be matched again. Steve was so charismatically brilliant that he inspired people to do the impossible, and he will be remembered as the greatest computer innovator in history.""

Google co-founder Sergey Brin:

""From the earliest days of Google, whenever Larry and I sought inspiration for vision and leadership, we needed to look no farther than Cupertino. Steve, your passion for excellence is felt by anyone who has ever touched an Apple product (including the MacBook I am writing this on right now). And I have witnessed it in person the few times we have met. On behalf of all of us at Google and more broadly in technology, you will be missed very much. My condolences to family, friends, and colleagues at Apple.""

U.S. President Barack Obama:

""Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. By building one of the planet's most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world. The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve's wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.""

YouTube founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen:

""It was an honor to have worked with Steve Jobs. He will forever remain an inspiration. He will be sorely missed, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.""

G.S. Choi, chief executive of Samsung Electronics:

""Samsung Electronics is saddened to hear of Chairman Steve Jobs' passing and would like to extend our deepest condolences. Chairman Steve Jobs introduced numerous revolutionary changes to the information technology industry and was a great entrepreneur. His innovative spirit and remarkable accomplishments will forever be remembered by people around the world. We would like to again express our sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and his colleagues.""

Google co-founder Larry Page:

""I am very, very sad to hear the news about Steve. He was a great man with incredible achievements and amazing brilliance. He always seemed to be able to say in very few words what you actually should have been thinking before you thought it. His focus on the user experience above all else has always been an inspiration to me. He was very kind to reach out to me as I became CEO of Google and spend time offering his advice and knowledge even though he was not at all well. My thoughts and Google's are with his family and the whole Apple family.""

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive, Facebook:

""Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you.""

U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California:

""Steve Jobs was a visionary who changed the way we live, an innovator whose products brought joy to millions, a risk-taker who wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo, and an entrepreneur who led one of the most creative companies of our time. His sage advice was respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle. His courageous fight against cancer brought strength to many. I hope it is a comfort to those who loved him, especially his family, that so many grieve his loss and are praying for them at this sad time.""

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates:

""I'm truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs' death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work. Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives. The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.""

Robert Iger, president and chief executive, The Walt Disney Company:

""Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted advisor. His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built. It will be the millions of people he inspired, the lives he changed, and the culture he defined. Steve was such an 'original,' with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time.""

California Governor Jerry Brown:

""Steve Jobs was a great California innovator who demonstrated what a totally independent and creative mind can accomplish. Few people have made such a powerful and elegant imprint on our lives. Anne and I wish to express our deepest sympathy to Steve's wife, Laurene, and their entire family.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A day before embarking on a trip to Latin America, President Obama described his planned talks with Latin American leaders as discussions among equals.

President Obama refuses to criticize Latin American leaders.

""Times have changed,"" Obama told CNN en Español Wednesday. Referring to his planned meeting later this week with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he said, ""My relationship with President Lula is one of two leaders who both have big countries, that we are trying to solve problems and create opportunities for our people and we should be partners.

""There's no senior partner or junior partner.""

Obama and Lula da Silva are among leaders scheduled to attend the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago.

Obama refused to criticize the leaders of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, who have taken measures to change their constitutions to extend their holds on power.

""I think it's important for the United States not to tell other countries how to structure their democratic practices and what should be contained in their constitutions,"" he said. ""It's up to the people of those countries to make a decision about how they want to structure their affairs.""

Asked how he plans to interact with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a fierce critic of the United States who once described former President George Bush as the devil, Obama offered no criticism. ""Look, he's the leader of his country and he'll be one of many people that I will have an opportunity to meet.""

Though he said he believes the United States has a leadership role to play in the region, Obama qualified that role, saying, ""We also recognize that other countries have important contributions and insights. We want to listen and learn as well as talk, and that approach, I think, of mutual respect and finding common interests, is one that ultimately will serve everybody.""

Asked about Cuba, Obama, who recently eased restrictions on travel and sending money to the island, offered a prod and a carrot to Havana.

""What we're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how Cuba operates that assures that political prisoners are released, that people can speak their minds freely, that they can travel, that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted,"" he said.

""And if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in Cuba, then I think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes.""

Obama sought to distance his administration from that of his predecessor, noting that he plans to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where ""some of the practices of enhanced interrogation techniques, I think ran counter to American values and American traditions.""

He said his team has spoken with the Spanish government about a Spanish judge's call for an investigation into the role of Bush administration officials in the detention of five Spaniards at Guantanamo.

But he did not dwell on his predecessor's legacy. ""I'm a strong believer that it is important to look forward and not backward and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there.""

Though the U.S. image abroad may have suffered in recent years, ""there's a reason why there are consistently so many immigrants to our country from Latin America,"" he said.

Obama lauded Mexican President Felipe Calderon, with whom he is to meet Thursday in Mexico City, as having done ""an outstanding and heroic job in dealing with what is a big problem right now along the borders with the drug cartels.""

He vowed that the United States can be counted on to help. ""We are going to be dealing not only with drug interdiction coming north, but also working on helping to curb the flow of cash and guns going south,"" Obama said.

Obama described himself as ""a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform,"" and said he has met with the congressional Hispanic Caucus ""to try to shape an agenda that can move through Congress.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Shots fired at a congressman's campaign headquarters. Windows smashed at Democratic offices across the country. A coffin placed on a lawmaker's lawn. Hate-filled voice mail messages left on members of Congress' phone lines.

Those are just some of the incidents reported since the House passed historic health care reform legislation Sunday -- a bill that became the law of the land.

The issue has unleashed a deep-seated anger from those worried about a government takeover of health care, and what they deem as the process being ""rammed through"" Congress.

James Leach, with the National Endowment for the Humanities, said that while many of the acts may be protected under First Amendment rights, ""that doesn't mean that they're morally justified.""

""And we have to think of ourselves as, 'what kind of people are we?' "" Leach said. ""Are we one people working together with rival thoughts, or are we enemies within? And I think there's something that's been let loose in American politics that has to be thought about.""

That anger was visible in unruly protests by health care activists at the Capitol over the weekend.

Republican House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery, some of whom carried messages like ""Vote no or else"" or ""If Brown won't stop it, a Browning will"" -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol.

But the anger has boiled over into physical and verbal threats. Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states, and federal agents are investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman's brother was related to the lawmaker's yes vote.

Republicans have the right to be angry over the Democrat's health care bill, but ""resorting to violent measures is exactly the wrong way to send a message,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Thursday night.

Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, confirmed Thursday that his district office in Queens received an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter.

Later Thursday, Weiner told CNN that initial tests indicated the powder was not a biological agent, but that he still was awaiting final word from the New York Police Department. Workers at the office turned over their clothes for testing and were given protective suits before being allowed to go home a few hours later, Weiner said.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are now looking into the threats, and at least 10 House Democrats have been given extra security.

The voice mail has been vicious toward Michigan's Bart Stupak, who switched his vote to seal the deal for the bill. He has released one of the voice mails.

Listen to the voice mail

""Stupak, you are a lowlife, baby-murdering scumbag, pile of steaming crap. You're a cowardly punk, Stupak, that's what you are. You and your family are scum,"" an unidentified caller said. ""That's what you are, Stupak. You are a piece of crap.""

""Go to hell, you piece of [expletive deleted]"" another caller said.

On Sunday, Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri had a coffin placed on his lawn, said his spokeswoman, Sarah Howard. She said Tea Party protesters at his office in St. Louis had a coffin with them and later brought it to his house. The coffin was later removed, she said.

Democratic congressional leaders have demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday's vote on the health care system overhaul.

The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, condemned the threats and vandalism, telling reporters Thursday that it ""should not be part of a political debate.""

""There are ways for people to channel their anger, and they should do it in a constructive way,"" he said.

Liz Mair, a Republican consultant, said protesters ""are unfortunately crossing a line.""

""When we're talking about violence, vandalism, threats, that crosses a legal line, in addition to being in plain old bad taste,"" Mair said. ""And I think that there's a lot that is in plain old bad taste that is going on.""

Democrats aren't the only ones being targeted.

Rep. Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, said Thursday that a bullet had been fired through a window at his campaign office in Richmond, Virginia.

Watch Cantor warn against Democrats ""fanning flames""

A Richmond police spokeswoman confirmed to CNN that a bullet was fired at the congressman's office. ""We are investigating the circumstance surrounding it,"" spokeswoman Karla Peters said.

Cantor also said that he had received threatening messages but that he would not publicly release the messages out of concern that doing so would only incite further violence.

He also accused Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- a member of the Democratic House leadership -- of ""fanning the flames"" of violence by using threats that have been made against Democratic members ""as political weapons.""

iReport: 'Violent Threats after the Healthcare Signing'

""Enough is enough,"" Cantor said. ""It has to stop.""

Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse hit back against Cantor's claims.

""We disagree with the charge made by Rep. Cantor today that Democrats are using acts of violence for political gain,"" he said. ""Let's be clear: Calling on Republican leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate.""

Another Republican -- Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida -- said in a news release Thursday that she received what appeared to be a death threat on her district office's voice mail.

""Just wanna let you know I have 27 people that are going to make sure that this b**** does not live to see her next term. Goodbye,"" the voice mail said, according to the release.

Brown-Waite said she contacted both the Capitol Police and the Hernando County sheriff, and they are ""looking into the matter and subpoenaing telephone records.""

At least one of the threats aimed at lawmakers appears to be racially based.

House Democratic Majority Whip James Clyburn, who is African-American, said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home.

""We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up,"" Clyburn told CNN. ""We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. It doesn't make sense. That's not what a democracy is all about.""

Democratic officials and liberal Web sites are also upset that Sarah Palin used an image of crosshairs in a Facebook post this week listing 20 vulnerable Democrats who voted for the legislation. She plans to target them this election year with money from her political action committee.

Read more about Palin's targeting effort

Palin's team is fighting claims that she is encouraging threats of violence. One House member mentioned her Facebook posting during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns, a Democratic source told CNN's Dana Bash. Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room, the source said.

An adviser to Palin responded by pointing to several instances in which the former Alaska governor has urged supporters to focus their energies on civil debate and action at the ballot box, not extremist activities.

CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Dana Bash, Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick, Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Investigators are searching property that once belonged to one of five members of a Missouri family arrested on multiple child sexual abuse charges for ""a body or bodies,"" the Lafayette County sheriff said Wednesday.

Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said his department and other law enforcement agencies investigating the case are seeking witnesses and more possible victims.

""I believe that there is, and I believe every investigator here, after seeing the evidence, believes there's more victims,"" Alumbaugh said. ""Pedophiles don't stop at one.""

Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, are being held in the Lafayette County Jail with bails ranging from $30,000 to $75,000.

Six children, who are siblings, came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects, and a forced abortion, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City.

The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse, provided by one of the children, whose names are being withheld. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said, adding that he expected additional charges based on other victim statements.

Read story from CNN affiliate KMBC

Alumbaugh said investigators were also searching several properties for glass jars that some of the victims may have buried containing notes detailing the alleged abuse.

Read story from CNN affiliate KCTV

The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said. Additionally, he said, investigators are following other leads as well.

""There has been indications there are a body or bodies in various locations,"" Alumbaugh said.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents' long-forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head.

Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself.

Sheriff's detectives in Pinellas County, Florida, near St. Petersburg, say the boy found the .25-caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home.

""They are dealing with this very tragic situation, and at this point, no charges have been filed,"" said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff's office.

His stepfather found Jacob Larson, 12, with a gunshot wound to the head Friday. The stepfather called 911.

Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m., when his mother, Tracy Newman, leaves for work, and about 11 a.m., when his stepfather, Joseph Newton, returns home. The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m.

""A few years ago, they moved, and [the gun] was stored in the closet. The mother never checked it, never fired it,"" Barreda said.

""They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet. Both her and her husband forgot about it,"" she said.

Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer. Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident.

The sheriff's office says it's unlikely that they will face charges.

Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws.

Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down.

""Sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge,"" he said.

The CDC says one child, on average, every three days died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005, the last year data are available.

Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. But, he says, there are cases where accidents happen, not crimes.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm, so people have to be aware.

""It's a horrible thing, and those parents will blame themselves from here out, and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end,"" Bartlett said.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- I'm lost!

For American Girl book fans, the ""Happy New Year, Julie"" story is an ideal gift for holiday road trips.

Hopelessly, completely lost on a winding, backcountry road somewhere in Westchester County, N.Y. Did I mention it was night and pitch-black? ""How could you do this?"" asks my aggravated 16-year-old daughter, Mel.

I'm not even sure. One minute we're on the highway and a couple of wrong turns later, here we are. None of the maps in the car showed the road we were on. Finally, we spot some open shops and a kind saleswoman in the Gap gave me directions.

Guess what I want somebody to give me this holiday? A portable GPS! (Are you listening, elves?) L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com) has some that are under $100, TomTom (www.tomtom.com), has some for under $250. A GPS would be a welcome gift for any traveling family. It's no fun getting lost, whether close to home or on vacation in an unfamiliar city or country.

Of course, my favorite gift of all would be a trip. Give those you love most the gift of an adventure together someplace new, or someplace that holds special memories, whether you are celebrating a special anniversary, birthday or simply a good year. Outfitters, cruise lines and resorts will help you arrange a custom itinerary -- and give you a good ""reunion"" deal too. Just make sure you get everyone on board with the idea before you fork over your credit card for those nonrefundable deposits.

Give the adults different guidebooks about the region and if you are planning a trip to foreign shores, give each of the kids some Euros, Pesos, etc., to spend when they get there. They'll have fun and maybe hone a few math skills figuring out how much they've really got to spend.

Maybe you want to encourage your kids' or grandkids' interest in exploring the world beyond their community. Buy them a subscription to National Geographic Kids (www.shopng.org) and for preschoolers, National Geographic Little Kids (subscriptions are just $15 a year.)

Those planning road trips or plane trips with their children will thank you every time they travel, if you slip a portable DVD player under the tree or next to the Hanukkah Menorah. Disney (www.disneyshopping.com) has a new one that's compact and has twin 7-inch LCD screens and two sets of headphones. It sells for $179.99. Of course, you'll need a couple of new DVDs to watch. How about encouraging the young chefs in the gang with Pixar's ""Ratatouille,"" or spark your little pirate's sense of adventure with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" If you're planning a holiday trip, bring along your favorite holiday movie.

Books on tape are also a great bet for families who prefer the road to the skies. The story can become a shared experience because everyone, including the driver, can listen at the same time, assuming you can get the older kids to turn off their iPods. There are plenty of holiday stories, like ""A Christmas Carol"" performed by Jim Dale, who read the Harry Potter books so well, John Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas""(www.randomhouse.com/audio) read by Dennis Boutsikaris or Fannie Flagg reading her book ""A Redbird Christmas,"" which I just listened to on a long drive in Colorado. Also check out Brilliance Audio (www.brillianceaudio.com) for other titles like Adam Canfield's ""Watch Your Back"" about the adventures -- and misadventures of an intrepid middle-school reporter.

Good old-fashioned books, of course, are great gifts too, especially if you can find one that relates to an experience you've shared on vacation or to a place you plan to visit. Ask your local children's librarian for suggestions. Maybe you've taken the kids to Cirque de Soleil or the Big Apple Circus, if so check out ""The Painted Circus"" (www.kidscanpress.com), which features beautiful illustrations that play tricks on the eye -- great to read together on a plane or at a relative's house.

If you've been to San Francisco, buy your American Girl book fans (www.americangirl.com) the ""Happy New Year, Julie"" story about a girl growing up around San Francisco in the 1970s who celebrates the Chinese New Year with her best friend. An added plus: It will be fun for moms to share what their lives were like ""back in the old days"" through these historically accurate tales. I also like the Mini Mysteries from American Girl.

No one should travel these days without a camera in his or her pocket -- to capture all those funny moments that don't always end up in the family scrapbook. Even better, the kids can take charge of creating family vacation Web pages. The experts at Take Great Pictures (www.TakeGreatPictures.com) suggest the Olympus Stylus 770 SW ($379.95) because it is shockproof, waterproof, crushproof and only weights 5.5 ounces. For teens, check out the Casio EX-S880 ($249.95), which comes in bright colors and is about the size of a credit card. The Casio EX also features a YouTube Capture mode so they can upload videos to the Web. The experts suggest the Pentax Optio E40 (under $150) for kids as young as six.

No one, including kids, should travel without a lightweight, rolling duffel. Lands End (www.landsend.com) or L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com) offer them in a variety of colors and while you're at it, order a monogrammed fleece blanket for each child for those interminable car trips. I'm also a fan of fleece jackets and vests for travel because they're lightweight and dry quickly. You can find them everywhere, even for young kids. (Check out the selection at Patagonia (www.patagonia.com).

Happy shopping. E-mail to a friend

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Samuel Fahrer and Sidney Lipson shake hands and smile. It's the first time the men have seen each other in 64 years. They were U.S. soldiers back on a forced death march in Nazi Germany in April 1945.

Sidney Lispson, left, and Samuel Fahrer meet for the first time in 64 years. They were in a Nazi slave labor camp.

""How you doing?"" Fahrer says.

It's a subdued moment for the two men. There are no tears, no pats on the back. The men have endured years of contained emotions from what happened six decades ago when they were prisoners of war and held as slaves inside Germany.

They have come to a hotel in Orlando to be honored by the Army this weekend for the first time.  Watch slave camp survivors reunite »

Fahrer and Lipson were among 350 soldiers held at the slave labor camp called Berga an der Elster, a largely forgotten legacy of the war and a subcamp of Buchenwald where soldiers were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels to hide German equipment.

More than 100 soldiers died at the camp and on the death march. Buchenwald was one of the largest and first concentration camps on German soil.  See photos inside Berga »

The Berga soldiers are being honored thanks in part to CNN.com users, who demanded the Army recognize the men, all in their 80s, after a series of reports late last year. The Army then conducted a months-long review of Berga at the urgings of Rep. Joe Baca, D-California, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama.

""These soldiers endured extreme hardships of forced labor, beatings, poor living conditions, and ultimately a forced march of over 250 kilometers [about 155 miles] prior to liberation by advancing U.S. Armed Forces,"" Army Secretary Peter Geren said at the conclusion of the review.

""The survivors of Berga certainly deserve both our thanks and recognition for their service and sacrifice.""

Geren is sending Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles to honor the survivors on Saturday. Six of the 22 Berga survivors will be at the event; most of those still living could not make it because of declining health.

Those here look forward to what the general has to say. They want desperately to know why the U.S. government commuted the death sentences of the two Berga commanders, Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz.

Both were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging until their commutations in 1948.

""I'm very happy the Army is sending a general to see us,"" Fahrer says. ""But they should've sent the general to see us a long time ago when some of the fellas were still alive. We're only 20 fellas left.""

Fahrer was one of the primary survivors after the war who fought to get the government to carry out the death sentences for Metz and Merz.

In a letter to survivors in January 1949, he wrote, ""Things are beginning to break our way. A little enthusiasm, a little more cooperation, a little more action, will accomplish a great, great deal now."" Now, 60 years later, he may finally get some answers.

""Let's see what the general has to say when he gets here,"" Fahrer says.

His comrade, Morton Brooks, says, ""I never wanted revenge, but I did think retribution would be proper. And I think they should've suffered a little bit longer for what they did. ... They wouldn't kick a dog, but they did that to us.""  Watch Morton Brooks describe the Germans' ""work to death"" program »

The two men finally hugged. ""I'm glad to see you,"" Fahrer says.

Some of the Berga soldiers were killed in cold blood, such as Morton Goldstein, shot through the head and then machine-gunned. His bullet-riddled body was placed in front of the barracks for all to see.

Bernard Vogel and Izzy Cohen were forced to stand without food and water for days, pushed to their deaths.

Cohen was a 32-year-old father of two young children. When he left for war, he kissed his family goodbye at a train station in California. He looked at his wife, Florence, and said, ""Whatever happens happens."" It was the last words he ever spoke to her.

Vogel's last words at Berga were: ""I want to die! I want to die!""  Hear Martin Vogel finally learn about his brother's final minutes »

""They killed us slowly,"" Fahrer says. ""They didn't feed us, they didn't give us anything, they didn't do anything.""

The memories are so terrible, so horrific that Sid Lipson doesn't remember much of anything about his captivity. ""I don't remember a damn thing from the march,"" he says.

Brooks says, ""I think it's best."" Brooks weighed 75 pounds when he was finally freed; Fahrer weighed 90.

""The United States government did not acknowledge the fact that we were put in this slave labor camp,"" Fahrer says, shaking his head. ""We went through all these things and nobody wants to give us any help. And finally, now ...""

Brooks went on to become a psychologist. He says his time in captivity was a ""$1 million experience that I wouldn't want to repeat for $2 million.""

His message to the world about the whole ordeal:

""We have to learn to talk to one another and live together. It's not necessary to go kill people for no reason.""

One of the survivors who won't be at this weekend's ceremony is Tony Acevedo, the U.S. medic who kept a diary inside Berga cataloguing the deaths and atrocities. It was Acevedo who CNN profiled in November, prompting a series of events culminating with the Pentagon deciding to honor the soldiers.  See Acevedo's diary »

Acevedo's wife, Loline, is too ill. He doesn't want to leave her side. ""The love of my life,"" he says.

During a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was ""very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field,"" according to the document.

Nixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows.

""We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,"" Nixon said. Medici said he was ""happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views"" were so close.

The declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington.

The memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series.

""This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],"" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it ""a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.""

The two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records.

""I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments,"" Kornbluh said.

He added that ""there's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret, and we're going to have to press Brazil and Washington to recover those documents.""

Despite the leaders' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret, word got out.

A declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a ""Cabinet leak."" Gen. Vicente Dale Coutinho, commander of Brazil's 4th Army, reacted to this by saying that the United States obviously wanted Brazil ""to do the dirty work,"" it said.

A declassified CIA national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded, ""Brazil will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors' internal affairs, but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes, to keep friendly governments in office, or to help place them there.""

The newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of Brazilian involvement in the Chilean coup of 1973, which the Nixon administration supported.

Kornbluh said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved, the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the United States and Brazil in Chile can finally be told.

The National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.

Kornbluh said he also hopes that surviving Chilean government and military officers from the era who knew of any arrangements with the Brazilian government will come forward and tell their stories.

""This is history for history's sake, but history will not find closure until it's fully aired,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Switzerland defender Philippe Senderos is in talks to leave Arsenal and join English Premier League rivals Everton, according to the Liverpool-based side.

Philippe Senderos is seeking to leave Arsenal to keep his World Cup hopes alive.

The 24-year-old has been out of favor with the London club for the past year or so, and spent last season on loan with Italy's AC Milan.

The center-back made only 15 appearances in his injury-hit stint with the Rossoneri, and returned to Arsenal where he has a year left on his contract.

Everton chairman Bill Kenwright confirmed that talks were underway, but said that no deal had been done despite an earlier claim by the Swiss Football Federation.

""We have been negotiating with Arsenal for the transfer of Philippe. Nothing has been concluded yet but talks are on going,"" Kenwright told Everton's official Web site on Tuesday.

Everton face the possible departure of England defender Joleon Lescott, the subject of two bids from big-spending EPL rivals Manchester City.  Transfer gossip: City to bid again for Lescott.

Manager David Moyes has rejected both offers and is determined to keep the player, who has been ruled out of recent pre-season friendly action due to a hip injury picked up on the tour of the United States.

Moyes needs cover for injured center-back Phil Jagielka, who is not expected to return to action until November.

The Swiss Football Federation had said on its official Web site on Monday that Senderos had agreed to join Everton because he needed regular first-team action ahead of next year's World Cup finals in South Africa.

Switzerland are level on points with Greece at the top of Group Two after six of 10 games, with the winner qualifying directly and the runner-up hoping to go into one of the four play-offs.

Senderos joined Arsenal in the summer of 2003 from Swiss club Servette, and established himself in the first team alongside Kolo Toure when regular Sol Campbell was injured.

However, he missed the 2006 Champions League final defeat by Barcelona due to his own injury, with England defender Campbell returning in his place to score the opening goal of the 2-1 reverse.

Senderos missed the start of the 2006-07 season after suffering a shoulder problem at the World Cup finals, and subsequently struggled to break back into the Arsenal team.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has a wealth of central defensive resources despite selling Toure to City last month, having brought in Belgium international Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax in June.

William Gallas, Johan Djourou, Mikael Silvestre and Alex Song are also competing for first-team places.

"(CNN) -- Officials in some Gulf Coast states spent the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on Friday gearing up for what could be the biggest threat to the region since Katrina hit in 2005.

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin attends a ceremony Friday honoring Hurricane Katrina victims.

Hurricane Gustav is poised to pass near or over the Cayman Islands on Friday night and over western portions of Cuba on Saturday. It may approach the U.S. Gulf Coast by Tuesday morning as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said Friday.

""Today, on that third anniversary, we've got to be thinking about the future,"" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said. ""As we pray for the best, we're going to prepare for the worst,""

Barbour announced Friday that Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast will begin evacuating this weekend to prepare for the Gustav's possible arrival.

The process will begin Saturday, with notices going out to people living in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or mobile homes, as well as people living in more permanent structures known as ""Mississippi cottages,"" he said.  Watch the Gulf Coast states prepare for Gustav »

The evacuation will begin in Harrison and Hancock counties on Sunday morning, Barbour said. Evacuation in Jackson County will begin Monday.

About 4,300 families live in FEMA trailers or mobile homes, and 2,800 live in Mississippi cottages, the governor's office said. He said he would urge people living in privately owned mobile homes to evacuate as well.

President Bush declared an emergency in Louisiana on Friday, freeing up federal aid and allowing FEMA to coordinate relief efforts.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to update their evacuation plans.

He said residents in certain southern parishes could be asked to leave Friday or Saturday. In Plaquemines Parish, where Hurricane Katrina roared ashore as a Category 3 storm days after its initial landfall in Florida, Parish President Billy Nungesser called for a mandatory evacuation beginning at noon Saturday.

Residents of the community of Grand Isle in Jefferson Parish were urged to begin voluntary evacuations Friday afternoon, and voluntary evacuations for Jean Lafitte, Crown Point, Barataria and areas outside the levee protection system are recommended beginning at noon Saturday, the parish said in a news release.

St. Bernard Parish, which was beginning transport Friday for those who would need assistance, said it expected to call a mandatory evacuation Saturday afternoon.

In New Orleans, which has yet to fully recover from Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday urged residents living in FEMA units to make evacuation plans in case city officials order them to leave.  Watch Sean Callebs report on if New Orleans is prepared »

""Travel trailers are unsafe during heavy winds,"" he said. ""As we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of Hurricane Gustav, I want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so.""

As of early this week, there were 2,829 FEMA trailers in Orleans Parish, the mayor's office said.

The city has designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses that would take them out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation. The city also arranged with Amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train, said Jerry Sneed of City Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.

Signs of mobilization were apparent at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, where nearly every departure gate had long lines of elderly people in wheelchairs. Rental car counters normally attended by tourists were filled with relief workers from the Red Cross and the Fire Department of New York's Disaster Assistance Response Team.

The DART team consisted of retired New York firefighters, jovial men with graying hair and larger waistlines. Many are volunteers assisting the Red Cross who were in New York during the September 11 attacks and wanted to give back.

The 40-member DART team of heavy-equipment operators, truck drivers and registered nurses was headed to Alexandria, Louisiana, to set up an evacuation shelter.

After the storm, the team will feed, shelter and re-supply people in the areas affected by Gustav.

""Whatever small way you're able to help, it's a great feeling,"" said Kevin Wallace, a 23-year FDNY veteran who's helped after six disasters. ""Whatever they need us to do, we do.""

All 2,500 inmates in Orleans Parish would be bused out from state and local facilities, Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff Marlin Gusman told the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

New Orleans Police Chief Warren Riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown, downtown, Central City and West Bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency.

During Katrina, many New Orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city. Sixty-seven officers were fired for it, Riley said.

In addition to the police department's actions, at least 1,500 Louisiana National Guard members arrived in New Orleans on Friday.

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his concerns for New Orleans are twofold. First, he was worried about areas of potential weakness in the levee system, which he said the Army Corps of Engineers monitor closely, and second, rainfall.

""You can build levees that are 100 feet high; it's not going to keep the rain out of the city. A very, very intense period of rain could flood the city, because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city,"" he said.

The only thing to do was prepare, he said.

""We evacuate; we protect the integrity of the levees; we continue to strengthen the levees; that's part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of New Orleans,"" he said.

The Louisiana National Guard has requested 20 helicopters from eight states to replace its helicopter air assault battalion, which is now serving in Iraq with its 20 UH-60 Black Hawks.

The Guard is asking for UH-60 helicopters for search and rescue, as well as CH-47s, Chinooks, which could drop large sandbags if the levees are breached.

A 40-person aviation headquarters unit also is being requested and probably will be provided by the Arkansas National Guard to handle air traffic control and communications for any air operations that might be needed.

In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry pre-emptively declared an emergency in 61 Texas counties. He said also the state had agreed to take into its shelters several thousand Louisiana residents, should they evacuate.

CNN's John Couwels, Chris Lawrence, Barbara Starr, Eric Marropodi and Kim Segal contributed to this report.

"(CNN) --   On Friday afternoon, Robin Meade, HLN anchor of ""Morning Express with Robin Meade,"" sky-dived just before former President George Herbert Walker Bush, who was commemorating his 85th birthday.

HLN Anchor Robin Meade chats with former president George H.W. Bush on his 85th birthday.

In recent years, Bush's jumps have been about fun and celebration, but he first parachuted out of a plane when he was a naval aviator shot down over the Pacific Ocean during World War II.

On Friday, Meade and Bush were each strapped to a member of the Army's Golden Knights parachute team. They made their jumps over Kennebunkport, Maine.

Before the jumps, Meade sat down with Bush to learn more about why he sky-dives. Plus, the former president weighed in on his and his son's legacies, Supreme Court justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor, and his view on the country's most pressing problems. This is an edited transcript of the interview.

Robin Meade: Thank you for making time for us to talk to you today.

George H.W. Bush: Oh, no, listen, I'm so glad you're here.

Meade: Happy birthday -- 85.

Bush: I thought you didn't know.

Meade: Everybody knows, right?

Bush: I know. It's exciting. It really is wonderful.

Meade: What's with your penchant for jumping still?

Bush: Well, two reasons. One, it still feels good. You still get a charge out of it. Not easy to do at 85, but ...

Meade: I don't think it's easy to do at any age.  Watch Bush talk about why he still sky-dives »

Bush: And secondly, just because you're old, that doesn't mean you can't do fun stuff. And you don't want to sit around drooling in the corner. And so it's a wonderful release.

And you know, because I was president, it sends a message all around. You can go out and get something going. Old guys can still have fun and still do stuff. And so, those are the two reasons. ...

Meade: You know, I'm thinking about, too, last Saturday we had the 65th anniversary of D-Day, and that was the first time, in World War II, that you jumped, because you had to ditch your plane.

Bush: Yes.

Meade: Being back with service members up in a plane and getting ready to jump, does that kind of rekindle your feelings of connection?

Bush: A little bit of deja vu. A little bit, but not that much anymore.

But yes, that's one of the reasons I made the first controlled jump, is because I did the first jump -- or had to get out of the plane. And that was kind of ugly. I pulled the ripcord too early and hit my head on the tail of the plane going by. I was just lucky I'm still alive.

And the parachute hung up for a minute on the tail of the plane.

It's all kind of war stories. If I start telling you that, then you'll tell me about your father's war stories or something, or grandfather's. And so it wouldn't be fair.

But I wanted to do it right. And I did it wrong then. It did save my life, but I did it wrong. So then I've been out with the Golden Knights and I made several solo jumps. And now it's tandem. I think they hope the old boy will remember to push.

Meade: Did I read somewhere that you asked President Clinton to jump once? And he hasn't jumped with you.

Bush: I may have asked him. I can't remember. Maybe I did, but I have a good relationship with him, a very good one.  Watch Bush leave plane, land »

Meade: Now that you're 85, are you thinking a little bit more about the ""L"" word, ""legacy?""

Bush: I was thinking of the ""L"" word being ""life."" Life its own self. But no, I think my view on legacy is let the historians figure out what I screwed up and figure out what I got right.

And I'm confident that, you know, we had a good administration and good people. And I think the same thing is true of our son. And you know, he had tough times and all, but he's doing it right. He's laying back there and he's not criticizing the president. And I'm very proud of him.  Watch Bush and sons talk after the jump »

And I hope that we both have set examples for how you ought to conduct yourself when you've been president and then go out of office. Let the other guy do it, and support him when you can, and be silent. Don't be out there criticizing all the time.

Meade: The one guy at the helm?

Bush: Yes. And the ""L"" word, so it doesn't -- I mean, my view is the historians will decide these things, for better or for worse and for right or for wrong. So I'm not doing any biography or anything like that. And I'm confident, because we had such a great team around us, that it will be favorable.

Meade: Tell me a little bit about Judge Sonia Sotomayor, she's someone that you appointed to a U.S. District Court.

Bush: District Court.

Meade: Now she's been nominated for the Supreme Court. What would her impact be on the Supreme Court, do you think?

Bush: I think she'd pull a ripcord just at the right time and make a very nice parachutist. I'm going to leave that to others to analyze, but she should be given a fair hearing. She should be accorded every courtesy that goes with her record as a judge and her aspirations to be a Supreme Court justice. And I have a feeling she will be confirmed, but again, I don't go into that day in and day out. ...

I think she's had a distinguished record on the bench and she should be entitled to fair hearings.  I like the way Sen. John Cornyn said it. I mean, he may vote for her, he may not. But he's been backing away from these -- backing off from those who use radical statements to describe her or to attribute things to her that may or may not be true.

I mean, she was called by somebody a ""racist."" Well, that's not right. I mean, it's not fair. It doesn't help the process to be out there name-calling. So let them decide whether they want to vote for her or not, and get on with it.

Meade: There are so many causes and so many problems, so many issues right now.

Bush: Right. Right.

Meade: What is our most pressing problem, do you think, in the country?

Bush: Well, I'd have to say as long as people are hurting, the economy, and those who are out of work, can't find work. I think it will get better. I remain optimistic about our recovery and all of that.

But I'd say that's -- and health care. But those -- we've got a lot of people working on those problems.

Meade: Oh, by the way, one more question. Is there going to be another jump after this?

Bush: I think when I finish this one, I'll say, ""See you on my 90th."" Whether I do it or not, it gives me a goal. I'm a goal-oriented guy. I really believe in goals. And so -- but we finish this one ...

Meade: I hope we do.

Bush: ... we'll all be standing there. And they'll say to you, ""What are you going to do?"" And you'll say, ""Five more years, I'm going to do another one."" And I'll say, ""I'll be there.""

Ninety years old. I'll do it.

Meade: Is it a deal? In five years, we'll do it again?

Bush: I'm for it. I'm for it.

Meade: OK. All right.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The defense anesthesiology expert in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor was found in contempt of court Wednesday for referring to his private talks with Dr. Conrad Murray during his testimony.

Dr. Murray did not testify in his own defense in his involuntary manslaughter trial and the judge refused to allow Dr. Paul White to base any of his testimony on anything other than what Murray told police.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor gave Dr. White 30 days to pay a $250 fine, but he also dropped a second contempt citation for derogatory comments he allegedly made about a rival witness.

Wednesday's contempt hearing was part of the aftermath of Dr. Murray's involuntary manslaughter that ended with a guilty verdict last week.

Another contempt hearing is set for November 29, the day Murray is set to be sentenced, for one of the defense lawyers who allegedly violated the judge's gag order by speaking to NBC's ""Today Show"" during the trial.

Murray defense lawyer Michael Flanagan, who was in court to defend Dr. White Wednesday, said after the hearing that he believed Murray should be eligible for early release if he is given prison time.

A California law that took effect last month provides for non-violent state inmates to be assigned to county jails to relieve state prison overcrowding. The Los Angeles County jail has a court-ordered early release program to relieve overcrowding, which allows non-violent offenders to serve much of their sentences at home with electronic monitoring.

Flanagan said Murray is not a safety threat to the public and should be included in the early release program.

Dr. White told reporters after the hearing that he still believed Jackson gave himself the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol and a sedative the coroner ruled killed the pop icon.

""I was aware that Michael Jackson had self-administered drugs in the past, propofol specifically, and so what's to say that he wouldn't do it again,"" White said. ""He was desperate. Murray was withholding from him the drug that he desperately desired.""

White, while under cross-examination by Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, referred several times to his private discussions with Dr. Murray about what happened the day Jackson died. Judge Pastor repeatedly warned him not to do so.

Finally, the judge cited White for contempt and set Wednesday's hearing to decide if he would be fined.

""There wasn't any intentional deception here or violation of the court order,"" defense lawyer Michael Flanagan told Pastor Wednesday. ""He was explaining to Mr. Walgren 'Hey, I can't answer that.'""

Prosecutor Walgren, who has grown a beard since the televised trial ended, told the judge that this was one of ""multiple instances"" where Dr. White was ""trying to sabotage the trial.""

""It was intentional and deliberate,"" Walgren said. ""It was an attempt to deny the people a fair trial.""

White told the judge he ""did my best as I was admonished by you to answer question truthfully and as completely as I could.""

""I apologize profusely if I disrespected you,"" White said. ""I learned a lot from this experience.""

Pastor ruled that White was guilty of violating his order by giving ""a non-responsive answer"" that dealt with ""no-go territory.""

While he could have fined him $1,000, he only imposed a $250 fine. Judge Pastor also dropped the other contempt charge which stemmed from an online report that quoted White allegedly calling prosecution anesthesiology expert Dr. Steven Shafer ""a scumbag.""

"(CNN) -- A bird struck an Arkansas hospital's helicopter Saturday, tearing a hole into the aircraft's nose and prompting the pilot to land early, according to officials and pictures taken after the landing.

A medical helicopter landed near Forrest City, Arkansas, on Saturday after striking a bird.

The chopper's pilot made a ""safe landing"" in that state after hitting a bird while returning to Baptist Health Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, hospital spokesman Mark Lowman said.

""I think the pilot just made a judgment call to set it down,"" Lowman said of the landing, which happened at 6:15 p.m. Saturday near Forrest City, Arkansas.

Video footage taken by CNN affiliate WREG showed a bird hanging out of a hole torn into the paneling on the chopper's nose. Part of the helicopter's windshield also was broken.

The pilot was slightly injured during the landing, and the other two crew members on board were uninjured, Lowman said.

Federal aviation officials are investigating, and the helicopter is not expected to be grounded for long, he said.

The helicopter was returning from a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where the crew had taken a patient.

The incident came two days after a US Airways jetliner was forced to land in New York's Hudson River, apparently after striking a flock of birds.

Shortly after the jet took off from New York's LaGuardia airport on Thursday, the crew reported seeing a flock of birds. Seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of loud ""thumps"" and both of the plane's engines failed.

The pilot, C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, landed the Airbus A320 in the Hudson, where all 155 people aboard were rescued.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The FBI is asking for public assistance in finding a serial bank robber dubbed the ""Granddad Bandit,"" who is believed to have struck in at least seven states.

The man, thought by authorities to be between 50 and 60 years old, is suspected in a string of nine bank robberies beginning in April in Houston, Texas, the FBI's Atlanta Field Office said in a news release.

Since then, police believe he has robbed two banks in Atlanta and single banks in Roanoke, Virginia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Dallas, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Syracuse, New York; and Tallahassee, Florida, the last bank robbery, which occurred on October 16.

""His robberies are described as being calm, with a deliberate attempt to not attract attention to himself,"" the FBI said. ""The robber quietly presents a demand note to the victim teller and thereafter departs the bank without disruption to normal banking business going on around him.""

The man is described as being between 6 feet and 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing between 220 and 250 pounds. He is described as stocky and bald, with short gray hair on the sides, and wears glasses.

A $10,000 reward is being offered by law enforcement. To offer information in the case, contact the Atlanta FBI.

In September, a man sought in at least 10 bank robberies in at least four states was arrested in Missouri. The FBI posted photos from the bank robberies on billboards, leading to the man identified as Chad Schaffner. A retired state trooper saw Schaffner in Kingdom City, Missouri, and notified authorities.

Schaffner is suspected of robbing banks in states including Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, authorities said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama claimed the second major legislative victory of his young administration Wednesday, signing a bill to provide federally funded health care to an estimated 4 million children.

President Obama says the SCHIP bill is a downpayment on his ""commitment to cover every single American.""

The final version of the new law, which expands the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by roughly $35 billion over the next five years, passed a sharply polarized House of Representatives earlier in the day, with almost every Democrat voting in favor of the expansion and most Republicans opposing it.

With the bill, Obama said at a White House ceremony, ""We fulfill one of the highest responsibilities that we have -- to ensure the health and well-being of our nation's children.""

The president said the bill was a downpayment on his ""commitment to cover every single American.""

The SCHIP expansion is Obama's second major legislative win in less than a week. The first was Thursday's approval of the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act, which makes it easier to sue employers for wage-based discrimination.  Learn more about the SCHIP program »

The expansion is also a sign of the strength of Washington's new Democratic majority. Former President George W. Bush vetoed two similar health care bills in 2007, arguing that the legislation would encourage families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.

Before the bill's passage, SCHIP covered almost 7 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance.

The new law boosts total SCHIP funding to approximately $60 billion. The expanded program will be financed with a 62-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.

""This is a day worthy of celebration. There can be no greater cause ... than protecting the well-being of our nation's children,"" New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the legislation's primary House author, said shortly before the bill's final passage on a 290-135 vote.

Passing the health program's expansion is ""morally the right thing to do by our children,"" said freshman Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Virginia. ""At a time when the cost of health care is crushing America's families ... this is an important lifeline.""

Opponents of the legislation argued that, among other things, it will allow undocumented immigrants to illegally access taxpayer-financed health care, and is insufficiently funded.

""This will go out of control just like all the other [entitlement] programs have, and our children will pay,"" Rep. Jack Linder, R-Georgia, warned during the House debate Wednesday.

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, ripped the bill as a ""foundation stone for socialized medicine in the United States,"" arguing that raising the income limit for SCHIP eligibility will serve as the basis for a massive expansion of government-run health care.

The Senate passed the expansion Friday in a 66-32 vote. All those voting against the bill were Republicans, though nine Republicans voted in favor of the measure.

"(CNN) -- Chastity Bono, gay-rights activist and child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, is in the early stages of transitioning from a female to a male and will be known as Chaz, his spokesman said Thursday.

Activist Chastity Bono is transitioning from female to male and will be known as Chaz.

""Chaz, after many years of consideration, has made the courageous decision to honor his true identity,"" Howard Bragman said in a written statement.

""He is proud of his decision and grateful for the support and respect that has already been shown by his loved ones. It is Chaz's hope that his choice to transition will open the hearts and minds of the public regarding this issue, just as his 'coming out' did nearly 20 years ago.""

Someone's decision to transition does not necessarily mean they are undergoing gender reassignment surgery, and in many cases they do not, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the Washington-based National Center for Transgender Equality.

""The whole media fixation on surgery is kind of misplaced,"" she said. ""Almost no transgender people ever have surgery. We don't have any idea how many do."" iReport.com: Do you have a transgender story?

An estimated one-quarter to one-half percent of the American population is transsexual, however, Keisling said. ""It's sort of a general term that encompasses both or either a social transition or a medical transition.""

Keisling said she was unaware of the specifics in Bono's case, but speaking generally, a transition means that he will now want to be ""known, seen, viewed"" as a male.

""The actual details depend on his needs and wants and his doctor's needs and wants,"" she said.

Bragman asked that the media ""respect Chaz's privacy during this long process, as he will not be doing any interviews at this time.""

Now 40, Bono as a little girl made regular appearances on her parents' show, ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour."" As an adult, he has been a longtime gay-rights advocate and been closely associated with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.  See more photos from Chastity Bono's life »

Bono's father, Sonny Bono, was a U.S. representative from California when he was killed in a skiing accident in January 1998.

"OXON HILL, Maryland (CNN) -- Crew members of the Maersk Alabama, safely back in the United States after being attacked by pirates last week off Somalia, recounted their ordeal Thursday.

Navy personnel recover the lifeboat from which Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued Sunday.

""They start firing before they climb, with AK-47,"" crew member Zahid Reza said.

""I was scared for my life. I was almost close to that. And they tried to shoot me many times,"" he said, pointing to his head. ""Pointing gun all over. Here, there, in the back.""

Pirates tried three times to board the U.S.-flagged cargo ship before their fourth attempt was successful, fellow crew member William Rios said, adding that the groups of pirates were different but that he thinks they were working together.

Rios said he was working on deck when he was called back to lock down the ship. Then, he said, there were gunshots, and an alarm went off to alert all crew members to wake up and get on deck.

""We went to our training,"" he said, declining to provide details: ""If I tell you all what we did, pirates, they would know.""  Watch the crew praise their captain »

The pirates intended to ask for a $3 million ransom, Reza said.

He said he and the ship's chief engineer took one of the pirates hostage. Reza said he persuaded the pirate -- whom he described as a young man, maybe 18 or 19 -- to trust him, pointing out that he is Bangladeshi and the pirate was Somali.

""His name is Abdul,"" Reza said. ""I told him, 'Trust me. I am Muslim; you are Muslim.' ""

He told Abdul he would take him to the engine room to find more crew members. When they got there, the room was dark, he said, and he didn't know the ship's chief engineer was in there.

He said the chief engineer jumped the pirate first, then Reza stabbed him with his knife, and the two men tied the pirate's hands and feet. Reza said he intended to kill the youth, but the chief engineer told him, ""No, we need him alive.""  Watch Reza talk about wanting to kill the pirate »

""He was fighting me and chief engineer, to get away from us. A lot of yelling, shouting and screaming.""

Rios said he went to the lifeboat, where Capt. Richard Phillips was being held, to exchange Abdul for Phillips but was unsuccessful.

The captain -- who offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew -- was rescued by U.S. Navy SEALs on Sunday. The SEALs, on the nearby guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, fatally shot three pirates and rescued Phillips. A fourth pirate was arrested.

""I feel great they got killed,"" Reza said. ""I am happy.""

He said he was proud of the Navy.

Phillips arrived in Mombasa, Kenya, aboard the Bainbridge on Thursday. The crew arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland overnight.  Watch crew arrive in U.S. »

Rios said Phillips is ""outstanding; he's extraordinary; he's [a] very brave man.""

Another crew member, John White, said they were ""damn lucky to be alive.""

Rios called for more security in the Gulf of Aden.

""Put more military to patrol the waterway for us transporting material back and forth,"" he said. ""... All the countries got to get involved with this.""

Reza echoed the call.

""I think government should get involved,"" he said. ""They should think about our safety, yes. ... This piracy is getting bigger and bigger.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The FBI is asking for public assistance in finding a serial bank robber dubbed the ""Granddad Bandit,"" who is believed to have struck in at least seven states.

The man, thought by authorities to be between 50 and 60 years old, is suspected in a string of nine bank robberies beginning in April in Houston, Texas, the FBI's Atlanta Field Office said in a news release.

Since then, police believe he has robbed two banks in Atlanta and single banks in Roanoke, Virginia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Dallas, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Syracuse, New York; and Tallahassee, Florida, the last bank robbery, which occurred on October 16.

""His robberies are described as being calm, with a deliberate attempt to not attract attention to himself,"" the FBI said. ""The robber quietly presents a demand note to the victim teller and thereafter departs the bank without disruption to normal banking business going on around him.""

The man is described as being between 6 feet and 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing between 220 and 250 pounds. He is described as stocky and bald, with short gray hair on the sides, and wears glasses.

A $10,000 reward is being offered by law enforcement. To offer information in the case, contact the Atlanta FBI.

In September, a man sought in at least 10 bank robberies in at least four states was arrested in Missouri. The FBI posted photos from the bank robberies on billboards, leading to the man identified as Chad Schaffner. A retired state trooper saw Schaffner in Kingdom City, Missouri, and notified authorities.

Schaffner is suspected of robbing banks in states including Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, authorities said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Brand new runways are opening at three major airports Thursday, giving the aviation community something to cheer about in a year of dismal economic and travel news.

Washington Dulles International Airport's new runway opens Thursday ahead of the busy holiday travel season.

Washington Dulles International Airport will get a fourth runway, its first runway addition since the airport opened in 1962.

Chicago's O'Hare International Airport's new runway is part of a massive, multi-billion dollar modernization program. Previously, six of the airport's seven runways intersected. When the entire project is completed in 2014, the airport will have eight runways in parallel configurations considered safer and more efficient.

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport's new runway is being especially welcomed because of the region's notoriously wet climate. The airport's third runway will allow planes to take off and land two abreast during inclement weather. The current runways are too close to allow simultaneous operations in foul weather. Airport officials claim the new runway will cut delays in half.

Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said travelers will benefit from coast to coast.  See runways at the three airports »

""It is going to make a difference,"" Peters said. ""It is going to allow us to conduct more operations, meaning more takeoffs and landings per hour at these airports and will help move passengers efficiently through.

""That, we hope, will give travelers a good experience this holiday season,"" she said.

President Bush, this week, touted the arrival of the three new runways, noting that 14 new runways will have opened during his administration.

However, aviation experts warn airport infrastructure still lags behind demand, and that real estate realities in the New York area, perceived to be the epicenter of aviation delays, mean that new runways are least likely to be built where they are most needed.  Watch what Web sites offer best travel deals »

""It would really be nice if we had even one new runway"" at each of the nation's most congested airports, namely LaGuardia, Newark and JFK,"" aviation consultant Darryl Jenkins said. ""It would do an enormous amount to relieve congestion throughout the entire nation."" iReport.com: What are your holiday travel plans?

Jenkins said new runways in New York are pipe dreams because of land constraints and local opposition.

""Local opposition wins. There's no opposition that is as tough to beat down as local opposition,"" he said.

Chicago O'Hare's International Airport, which has purchased more than 500 single-family homes to make room for expansion, remains in court battles with several property owners.

Aviation experts argue the experience at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia demonstrate that new runways are invaluable to airlines and travelers. A new runway that opened there in 2006 has increased operations by 25 to 30 flights an hour, shaved minutes off average flight delays and saved airlines $10 million a week in fuel costs, airport officials said.

Air traffic controllers are generally happy with the added concrete they will lord over.

""There's no greater supporter of runways than controllers,"" said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). ""It's reason to shout and celebrate from the rooftops.""

However, the new Dulles airport runway may not be of much benefit at the start.

Controller Chris Sutherland, the NATCA representative for the Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), explained that because only one taxiway has been completed, planes that land heading north must roll to a stop, turn around and taxi more than a mile and a half to the taxiway, costing the airlines both time and money.

""Bottom line, the users are going to fight us tooth and nail if we try to land them on that runway out there,"" Sutherland said. The airport also does not have the technology necessary to use all three parallel runways in inclement weather, he said.

""We're actually creating delays with additional new concrete and that's kind of going against why we built it in the first place,"" Sutherland said.

An airport official and Department of Transportation officials said Washington-Dulles International Airport must open the new runway before it can close the center runway and complete work on the remaining taxiways. Work is scheduled for the spring.

Jenkins jokingly said new runways inevitably come on line precisely when they are not needed, but he said airline delays are here to stay.

""There's every reason to believe that until we're all comfortably dead, we will all enjoy delays in air traffic,"" Jenkins said.

"(CNN) -- ""Family Ties"" actress Meredith Baxter made the media rounds Wednesday confirming the rumors that she is a lesbian.

""It was a later in life recognition,"" the actress explained to Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show Wednesday.

The National Enquirer recently ran a story about Baxter being spotted on a lesbian cruise through the Caribbean with a ""female friend,"" which was then picked up by celebrity blogs. As a result, the 62-year-old decided to tell her fans herself.

""I didn't want some tabloid to take the story and make it up,"" Baxter said in the interview. ""I wanted it to be in my own words.""

Baxter was also interviewed on Sirius XM Radio's ""The Frank DeCaro Show.""

Coming out was a difficult thing for the quiet actress to do. She told Lauer on ""Today"" that she's always ""lived a very private life. To come out and disclose stuff is very antithetical"" to who she is.

Baxter told DeCaro that she knew she could be outed when she went on the cruise with her partner, Nancy Locke, but she went anyway.

""We live a very open life at home,"" she said. ""Anyone who's a friend of mine, anyone who knows and cares about me knows. It's no secret that I'm gay, but it has been to the greater world.

""The reason I'm here [on the show] is because I'm saying, yes, I'm a lesbian.""

Baxter also told People magazine that she has been in a four-year relationship with Locke, who works as a building contractor. Baxter has been dating women for the past seven years, and ""the thought of being gay never crossed my mind,"" she said.

The actress was married three times before, during which she ""was never comfortable with herself,"" she told People. Now, she feels like she's ""being honest for the first time.""

Baxter has also come clean to her five kids, according to People. Her 25-year-old son Peter was all smiles. He told the magazine that he ""just couldn't stop smiling, because she finally figured it out.""

"Mission Viejo, California (CNN) -- When Marty Kubicki received a text message that his wife, Aahmes, and two teenage daughters, Olivia and Alexis, were alive in Haiti, he was overwhelmed with relief.

""I felt like an enormous burden had been placed off me, but at the same time I knew that they were OK. I always felt they made it,"" he said. Groups of church members have been volunteering at an orphanage for nearly six years, since church members Bill Manassero, his wife Suzette, and Jim Duggan opened the center.

But by Friday there was chaos at the Maison De Lumiere Orphanage in Haiti as 11 American missionary volunteers were trying to find a way to leave after severe shortages of food, water and medicine sparked anger in people they had been trying to help.

""People are becoming hostile at the missionary workers and we now find ourselves desperately trying to get them out,"" said Mike Maiolo, senior pastor of the volunteers' home church in Mission Viejo. He said he had received urgent messages from Haiti that everyone wanted to leave.

The Kubickis and the others from Mission Viejo Christian Church arrived in Port-Au-Prince a week ago to help assist nearly 100 abused and abandoned children at the orphanage.

The facility sustained heavy damage in the earthquake but no one was killed, he said.

Within hours of the quake, the volunteers became de facto nursing assistants after word spread that Maison De Lumiere was serving as a makeshift triage center.

""Lots of doctors and nurses have been coming by the facility because word's gotten out, so there's all these people being pulled out of rubble and they're assisting and attending to the injured as best as they can,"" Marty Kubicki said.

Judy Beltis left her husband, six daughters and five grandchildren in California when she came to Haiti on January 8. Moments after the walls and shelves around her collapsed, she found herself attending the injured and working to save lives, said her husband, Paul.

""This is a mom who couldn't put a Band-Aid on her kids when they had a cut finger because she was so squeamish, and now she's dealing with whatever needs to be done,"" he said.

On Thursday, the family was assured that Judy Beltis was safe and protected. ""I'm going to urge her at some point to come back and get a little rest and restoration, but I know she'll want to head right back,"" said daughter Jaime.

But that was before Maiolo received the urgent messages late Thursday.

He said the situation had deteriorated to the extent that no one felt safe going outside the compound. Contact with his missionary members in Haiti has been limited to occasional text messages, Internet streaming and e-mail, he said, and his volunteers have not been able to reach U.S. State Department officials.

""The world around us is in such need when something like this happens and we've got to be there for them, but at the same time, there must be a quick way to get them out when there is nothing more to give,"" Maiolo said.

"(Financial Times) -- When Macau unveiled record gambling revenues on Tuesday, the government was silent about the source of much of the cash fuelling the territory's boom: illegal money transfers from mainland China.

From pawn shops offering money withdrawal services, to underground banks using human mules to transport cash across the border, Macau tolerates the illicit methods that mainland punters use to bring money into the former Portuguese colony, which reverted to Chinese control in 1999.

Mainland tourists, who have made Macau the world's largest gambling centre, can legally bring only Rmb20,000 ($3,175) when crossing into the Chinese territory. But many gamblers bring more cash to the casino tables by using their Unionpay debit card to withdraw money -- for a fee.

""There is no risk. We pretend to sell the customer an expensive watch or a piece of jewellery, charge the amount in renminbi to the debit card, and then give him the equivalent amount in Macau patacas or Hong Kong dollars as if the customer had decided to return the object for an immediate cash refund,"" says the manager of a pawnshop up the street from the Grand Lisboa casino, Macau's oldest casino owned by Stanley Ho, the gambling tycoon.

The manager says the cardholder's records will register the transaction as a purchase. Unionpay, which was formed by China's big banks, says it bans such transactions, but the company declined to comment on the fact that the practice remained widespread. The company said it no longer released data on how much cardholders spent in Macau.

People familiar with the industry say the Macau government cannot afford to shut down the illegal services, which hundreds of pawn shops advertise publicly on neon signs.

""The Macau government's hands are tied,"" says one veteran Macau policeman. ""It is not going to initiate a crackdown, because over 75 per cent of its revenue comes from gaming taxes.""

About 16m mainland Chinese visited Macau in 2011, an increase of more than 20 per cent on the previous year, and 60 per cent more than the 10m who visited in 2006. Analysts estimate that up to 30 per cent of Macau's gaming revenue could be channelled through illegal channels.

""Banking restrictions make it very difficult to transfer funds to Macau legitimately, but it is easy for people to find ways [around the rules],"" says a senior Chinese bank manager who gambles in Macau.

While the debit card cashback service is the most visible source of money for the less well-heeled punters, those with deeper pockets have found different ways to avoid the restrictions.

VIP punters -- whom analysts estimate generate 70 per cent of Macau's gaming revenues -- gamble on credit provided by so-called junket operators who seek out wealthy mainland gamblers.

The junket operators receive commissions from the casinos or get a share of the profits. They, or their agents, sometimes use underground banks to return the money they have collected as debt on the mainland to Macau. The lenders use criminal gangs from Fujian and Guangdong provinces who in turn pay human mules as little as $5 -- compared with Guangdong's average daily wage of $7 -- to smuggle cash across the border.

While the underground banks are part of what is known as the shadow banking system in China, providing credit to cash-strapped companies, their Macau-related business is limited to transferring money from other sources.

One former junket operator and a Hong Kong owner of a mainland factory in Guangdong province, just across the border from Macau, described how operators also use Hong Kong business people who own companies on the mainland to transfer money illegally.

He said operators handed over renminbi debts collected on the mainland to the factory owner, who used the money to pay his staff wages. Then, the owner sent the equivalent in Hong Kong dollars from his Hong Kong bank account to the operator's account in Macau. Both sides profited by agreeing a mutually beneficial exchange rate.

There is no public data available to indicate exactly how much of Macau's gaming revenue comes from illegal channels, and casino operators and government officials refuse to speak about the issue. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau refused to comment.

""Neither the Macau government nor Beijing wishes to damage the Macau economy. There's good reason to keep the scale of illegal transactions a closely guarded secret so nobody needs to take action,"" says the police officer.

While Beijing does not condone gambling on the mainland, it has so far not cracked down on the illegal transfers. Analysts say it is unlikely to take action as the Chinese Communist party does not want to destabilise Macau just 13 years after the city returned to Chinese rule.

""Beijing is unlikely to take measures such as tightening visa restrictions or clamping down on debit card cashback services, as long as Macau is seen as a safe and enjoyable place to visit and casino operators refrain from activities or comments that might portray the city in a bad light,"" says Grant Govertsen, the Macau-based managing partner at Union Gaming Research, a US research group.
